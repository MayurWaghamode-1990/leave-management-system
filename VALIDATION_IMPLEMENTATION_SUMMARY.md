# Validation Implementation Summary - Option 2

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Phase:** Real-time Validations (Option 2)

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive real-time validations for the Leave Management System. All validations were already implemented in the `policyEngine.ts` but were **disabled** in the leave creation endpoint. This implementation enables and integrates all validations with the database.

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Leave Creation Endpoint (`backend/src/routes/leaves.ts`)

#### Changes Made:
- ✅ **Enabled Policy Validation Engine** (was commented out)
- ✅ **Added Half-Day Period Support** (`FIRST_HALF` / `SECOND_HALF`)
- ✅ **Migrated from Mock Data to Database (Prisma)**
  - Replace mock leave requests with `prisma.leaveRequest`
  - Replace mock leave balances with `prisma.leaveBalance`
  - Replace mock overlap checks with database queries
- ✅ **Integrated Validation Results** with proper error handling
- ✅ **Updated Auto-Approval Logic** to use database transactions
- ✅ **Fixed Date Handling** to use Date objects instead of strings

#### Specific Code Changes:

**Before (Lines 1014-1028):**
```typescript
// Temporarily disable policy validation for testing
const validationResult = {
  isValid: true,
  errors: [],
  warnings: [],
  requiredDocumentation: false,
  autoApprovalEligible: true,
  approvalChain: []
};

// Skip policy validation temporarily
// const validationResult = await leaveValidationEngine.validateLeaveRequest(validationRequest);
// if (!validationResult.isValid) {
//   throw new AppError(`Leave request validation failed: ${validationResult.errors.join(', ')}`, 400);
// }
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ ENABLED: Policy validation with comprehensive checks
const validationResult = await leaveValidationEngine.validateLeaveRequest(validationRequest);

// Check if validation failed
if (!validationResult.isValid) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Leave request validation failed',
    errors: validationResult.errors,
    warnings: validationResult.warnings
  });
}
```

---

## Validations Now Active

### ✅ 1. Leave Balance Validation
**File:** `backend/src/services/policyEngine.ts` (Lines 204-278)

**Features:**
- Checks actual database balance for the leave type
- Includes pending leave requests in balance calculation
- Validates against real-time available balance
- Provides detailed error messages with available balance

**Example:**
```
If employee has 5 days available and 2 days pending approval:
- Real available = 3 days
- Requesting 4 days = ❌ Error: "Insufficient leave balance. Available: 3 days (after pending: 2), Requested: 4 days"
```

---

### ✅ 2. Maternity Leave Eligibility Validation
**File:** `backend/src/services/policyEngine.ts` (Lines 289-327)

**Features:**
- ✅ Gender check: Only `FEMALE` employees
- ✅ Marital status warning: Recommends `MARRIED` status
- ✅ One maternity leave per year check
- ✅ Requires medical documentation
- ✅ Prevents duplicate requests

**Example Errors:**
- ❌ "Maternity leave is only available for female employees"
- ❌ "You already have a maternity leave request for this year (Status: APPROVED)"
- ⚠️ "Medical certificate and pregnancy proof required for maternity leave"

---

### ✅ 3. Paternity Leave Eligibility Validation
**File:** `backend/src/services/policyEngine.ts` (Lines 330-371)

**Features:**
- ✅ Gender check: Only `MALE` employees
- ✅ Marital status check: Must be `MARRIED` (required, not just warning)
- ✅ One paternity leave per year check
- ✅ Requires birth certificate/medical documentation
- ✅ Prevents duplicate requests

**Example Errors:**
- ❌ "Paternity leave is only available for male employees"
- ❌ "Paternity leave is only available for married employees"
- ❌ "You already have a paternity leave request for this year (Status: PENDING)"
- ⚠️ "Birth certificate or medical certificate required for paternity leave"

---

### ✅ 4. Weekend/Holiday Exclusion in Leave Calculation
**File:** `backend/src/services/policyEngine.ts` (Lines 167-199, 633-672)

**Features:**
- ✅ Calculates actual working days excluding weekends (Saturday/Sunday)
- ✅ Excludes declared holidays from leave calculation
- ✅ Location-specific holiday calendars
- ✅ Adjusts total days automatically
- ✅ Provides warnings when dates adjusted

**Example:**
```
Employee requests leave: Jan 10-15 (6 calendar days)
- Jan 13-14: Weekend (Saturday-Sunday)
- Actual working days: 4 days
- Warning: "Leave days adjusted: Requested 6 days, actual working days 4 (excluding weekends/holidays)"
```

**Code:**
```typescript
async calculateBusinessDays(startDate: Date, endDate: Date, location?: string): Promise<number> {
  // Excludes weekends (Saturday=6, Sunday=0)
  // Fetches holidays from database for date range
  // Returns only working days count
}
```

---

### ✅ 5. Half-Day Leave Selection Support
**Database Schema:** Already present in `schema.prisma`
```prisma
model LeaveRequest {
  isHalfDay       Boolean       @default(false)
  halfDayPeriod   String?       // FIRST_HALF, SECOND_HALF
}
```

**API Changes:**
- ✅ Added `halfDayPeriod` parameter to leave creation endpoint
- ✅ Validation: Required when `isHalfDay = true`
- ✅ Validation: Must be either `FIRST_HALF` or `SECOND_HALF`
- ✅ Stored in database with leave request

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "CASUAL_LEAVE",
  "startDate": "2025-11-05",
  "endDate": "2025-11-05",
  "isHalfDay": true,
  "halfDayPeriod": "FIRST_HALF",
  "reason": "Personal work"
}
```

---

### ✅ 6. Comp Off Eligibility Validation
**File:** `backend/src/services/compOffService.ts` (Already Comprehensive!)

**Features:**
- ✅ Work Type Validation: Must be `WEEKEND`, `HOLIDAY`, or `EXTENDED_HOURS`
- ✅ Minimum Hours: 5 hours for half-day, 8 hours for full-day
- ✅ Maximum Hours: 12 hours per day
- ✅ Weekend Work: Must be Saturday or Sunday
- ✅ Holiday Work: Date must be a declared holiday
- ✅ Manager Verification Required
- ✅ No Duplicate Work Logs on same date
- ✅ 30-day window for logging work
- ✅ 3-month expiry from approval date

**Validation Code (Lines 363-377):**
```typescript
// Validate weekend work
if (data.workType === 'WEEKEND') {
  const dayOfWeek = workDate.getDay();
  if (dayOfWeek !== 0 && dayOfWeek !== 6) { // Not Saturday or Sunday
    errors.push('Weekend work must be on Saturday or Sunday');
  }
}

// Validate holiday work
if (data.workType === 'HOLIDAY') {
  const isHoliday = await this.isHolidayDate(workDate);
  if (!isHoliday) {
    errors.push('Work date must be a declared holiday for holiday work type');
  }
}
```

## Seed Data for Testing

### Married Employees (for Maternity/Paternity Testing)
```typescript
// Married Female Employee - Maternity Leave Testing
{
  firstName: 'Priya',
  lastName: 'Sharma',
  email: 'priya.sharma@company.com',
  gender: 'FEMALE',
  maritalStatus: 'MARRIED',
  country: 'INDIA'
}

// Married Male Employee - Paternity Leave Testing
{
  firstName: 'Rajesh',
  lastName: 'Kumar',
  email: 'rajesh.kumar@company.com',
  gender: 'MALE',
  maritalStatus: 'MARRIED',
  country: 'INDIA'
}
```

### Single Employees (for Comparison Testing)
```typescript
{
  maritalStatus: 'SINGLE',
  gender: 'FEMALE' // Should fail paternity, warn for maternity
}

{
  maritalStatus: 'SINGLE',
  gender: 'MALE' // Should fail paternity
}

## Next Steps - Option 1 (Automation)

### 1. Monthly Accrual Scheduler
- Cron job to run on 1st of every month
- Credit CL and PL based on policy
- Handle pro-rata for mid-month joiners
- Send notifications to employees

### 2. Year-End Carry-Forward Automation
- Run on December 31st
- Expire CL balances
- Carry forward PL (max 30 days)
- Update balances for new year

### 3. Comp Off Expiry Automation
- Daily/weekly cron job
- Mark expired comp off requests (3 months from approval)
- Send expiry reminders (7 days before)
- Update balances

### 4. Leave Balance Expiry
- CL expires on Dec 31 (no carry-forward)
- PL max 30 days carry-forward
- Auto-adjust balances

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries Per Leave Request
1. Policy validation: ~5-8 queries
   - User lookup
   - Leave balance check
   - Pending requests check
   - Holiday check
   - Existing maternity/paternity check
2. Overlap check: 1 query
3. Leave creation: 1 query
4. Balance update (if auto-approved): 1 query
5. Manager lookup: 1 query

**Total:** ~10-12 queries per request

### Optimization Opportunities
- ✅ Use `include` to reduce queries (already done)
- ✅ Batch holiday checks (already implemented)
- 🔄 Consider caching holiday data
- 🔄 Consider caching policy rules
