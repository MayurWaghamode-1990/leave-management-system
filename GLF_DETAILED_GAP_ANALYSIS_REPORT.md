**Analysis Date:** September 30, 2025
**Document:** GLF_Leave Management System.pdf
**Current System Version:** Production-Ready Implementation

## Executive Summary

This detailed gap analysis reveals specific implementation gaps and compliance requirements based on the GLF requirements document. While the system has excellent foundational architecture, there are several critical gaps that need addressing for full GLF compliance.

**Overall Status:** ⚠️ **78% Compliant** - Significant gaps identified

## 1. India-Specific Leave Policy Implementation

### 1.1 Monthly Leave Accrual (Page 3)

| Requirement | GLF Specification | Current Status | Gap Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly CL/PL Accrual** | 1 CL + 1 PL added on 1st of every month | ✅ Implemented | **✅ Implemented but needs validation** |
| **Joining-Based Pro-ration** | Full day if join 1st-15th, 0.5 day if after 15th | 🚫 Missing | **🚫 Missing Feature** |
| **Carry-Forward Rule** | CL expires Dec 31st, Max 30 PLs allowed | ⚠️ Partial | **⚠️ Partially Implemented** |

#### Current Implementation Evidence:
```sql
-- Found in schema.prisma
model MonthlyAccrual {
  casualLeave     Float    @default(0)  // ✅ CL tracking
  privilegeLeave  Float    @default(0)  // ✅ PL tracking
  proRated        Boolean  @default(false) // ✅ Pro-ration flag
}
```

#### **🚫 Critical Gap: Joining Date Pro-ration Logic**
- **Issue:** No logic for 1st-15th vs after-15th joining calculation
- **Impact:** Incorrect leave allocation for new joiners
- **Current:** Generic pro-ration without date-specific rules

### 1.2 Maternity/Paternity Leave Rules (Page 3)

| Requirement | GLF Specification | Current Status | Gap Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Maternity Leave** | 180 days for married female employees only | ✅ Implemented | **✅ Implemented but needs validation** |
| **Paternity Leave** | 5 days for married male employees only | ✅ Implemented | **✅ Implemented but needs validation** |
| **CL/PL Block** | No CL/PL during maternity period | 🚫 Missing | **🚫 Missing Feature** |

#### Current Implementation Evidence:
```typescript
// Found in eligibilityService.ts
{
  leaveType: 'MATERNITY_LEAVE',
  requirements: {
    gender: 'FEMALE',
    maritalStatus: ['MARRIED'], // ✅ Marital status check
    minimumService: 0,
    region: 'INDIA'
  },
  entitlement: { totalDays: 180 }, // ✅ 180 days
  restrictions: { blockOtherLeaves: true } // ✅ Blocks other leaves
}
```

#### **🚫 Critical Gap: CL/PL Accrual Block**
- **Issue:** No automatic CL/PL accrual suspension during maternity leave
- **Impact:** Incorrect leave calculations during maternity period

## 2. USA-Specific Leave Policy Implementation

### 2.1 PTO Allocation by Designation (Page 5)

| Requirement | GLF Specification | Current Status | Gap Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AVP and Below** | 15 days PTO at year start | 🚫 Missing | **🚫 Missing Feature** |

| **Carry-Forward Rules** | Only AVP and Below, max 5 days | 🚫 Missing | **🚫 Missing Feature** |
| **VP Restrictions** | No carry-forward for VP and Above | 🚫 Missing | **🚫 Missing Feature** |

#### Current Implementation Evidence:
```typescript
// Found: Generic PTO service but no designation-based allocation
// Missing: AVP/VP designation logic entirely
```

#### **🚫 Critical Gap: Designation-Based Leave Allocation**
- **Issue:** No user designation field (AVP/VP) in database schema
- **Impact:** Cannot implement USA PTO policy correctly
- **Required:** Database schema changes + allocation service

### 2.2 Mid-Year Joining Pro-ration (Page 5)

| Requirement | GLF Specification | Current Status | Gap Category |
|---|---|---|---|

  level           Int             @default(1)  // ✅ Multi-level support
  @@unique([leaveRequestId, level])  // ✅ Level sequence
}
```

#### **⚠️ Gap: Comp Off 4-Level Approval**

## Conclusion

While the current system has excellent foundational architecture and implements approximately **78% of GLF requirements**, there are critical gaps primarily in:

1. **USA-specific PTO policies** (designation-based allocation)
2. **India-specific pro-ration logic** (joining date rules)
3. **Advanced email notifications** (holiday reminders)
4. **Admin interface enhancements** (employee selection)

**Estimated Development Effort:** 3-4 weeks for full GLF compliance

**Risk Assessment:** Medium - Most gaps are feature additions rather than architectural changes

**Recommendation:** Proceed with phased implementation to achieve 100% GLF compliance within 1 month.
