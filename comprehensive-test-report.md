# Comprehensive Test Report: Leave Management System

## Executive Summary

**Test Date:** September 24, 2025
**Test User:** engineering.manager@company.com (Rajesh Kumar)
**Test Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Backend Server:** http://localhost:3001
**Frontend Server:** http://localhost:5174

## Updates Applied During Testing

### ✅ **UI Fixes Implemented**
- **Fixed React Key Duplication:** Resolved "Encountered two children with the same key" warnings in LeavesPage table
- **Fixed Backend ID Generation:** Replaced simple counter with timestamp-based unique ID generation
- **Improved Frontend Stability:** Table rendering now uses unique keys (`${request.id}-${index}`) to prevent React warnings

## Test Results Overview

### ✅ **Functioning Correctly**
- **Leave Type Retention:** All leave types (CASUAL_LEAVE, SICK_LEAVE, EARNED_LEAVE, COMPENSATORY_OFF) are properly retained when creating leave requests
- **Half-Day Leave Calculation:** Half-day leaves are correctly calculated as 0.5 days
- **Leave Request Cancellation:** Users can successfully cancel pending leave requests
- **Authentication:** Login functionality works correctly for the test user
- **Basic Leave Creation:** System successfully creates leave requests with proper validation

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues Identified**

#### 1. **Multiple Leave Types for Same Date Range - CONFIRMED BUG**
- **Issue:** System allows creating multiple leave requests with different leave types for identical date ranges
- **Severity:** High
- **Evidence:** Successfully created 3 different leave requests (CASUAL_LEAVE, EARNED_LEAVE, COMPENSATORY_OFF) for the same dates (2025-10-14 to 2025-10-16)
- **Business Impact:** Could lead to incorrect leave calculations, payroll discrepancies, and system abuse
- **Recommendation:** Implement date range overlap validation before allowing new leave requests

#### 2. **Leave Balance Deduction Not Working - CONFIRMED BUG**
- **Issue:** Leave balances are not updated when leave requests are created/approved
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Evidence:**
  - Initial CASUAL_LEAVE balance: 12 days
  - Created leave request for 2 days
  - Final CASUAL_LEAVE balance: 12 days (unchanged)
  - Expected deduction: 2 days
  - Actual deduction: 0 days
- **Business Impact:** Incorrect leave balance tracking, potential over-utilization of leave entitlements
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper balance deduction logic in the leave approval workflow

#### 3. **Leave Type Retention - RESOLVED**
- **Initial Concern:** Leave type always showing as "Earned Leave"
- **Test Results:** Leave types are properly retained and displayed correctly
- **Status:** This issue appears to be resolved in the current system

- **Result:** System allowed 3 different leave types for identical dates

| Attempt | Leave Type | Status | Request ID |
|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| 1 | CASUAL_LEAVE | ✅ Created | 11 |
| 2 | EARNED_LEAVE | ✅ Created | 12 |
| 3 | COMPENSATORY_OFF | ✅ Created | 13 |

### Balance Deduction Test
- ❌ **Status:** FAIL
- **Initial Balance:** 12 days (CASUAL_LEAVE)
- **Leave Request:** 2 days
- **Expected Final Balance:** 10 days
- **Actual Final Balance:** 12 days
- **Deduction Applied:** 0 days

### Half-Day Leave Test
- ✅ **Status:** PASS
- **Request ID:** 15
- **Total Days:** 0.5 (correct)
- **Half-Day Flag:** true

### Cancellation Test
- ✅ **Status:** PASS
- **Request ID:** 16
- **Result:** Successfully cancelled pending leave request

## Edge Cases Tested

### 1. Weekend Leave Requests
- **Status:** Working as expected
- **Note:** System allows weekend leave requests (business requirement dependent)

### 2. Past Date Validation
- **Status:** Working correctly
- **Note:** System prevents leave applications more than 30 days in the past

### 3. Retroactive Leave Applications
- **Status:** Working within limits
- **Note:** System allows retroactive applications within 30-day window

## Database Consistency

### Leave Requests
- **Total Requests Created:** 16
- **Requests with Valid IDs:** 16
- **Database Consistency:** ✅ Good

### Leave Balances
- **Balance Records:** 4 leave types per user
- **Balance Integrity:** ✅ Structure intact, but deduction logic broken

## Backend Logs Analysis

The backend server is running successfully with the following observations:
- WebSocket connections working correctly
- Email service in demo mode (expected for testing)
- Database connections stable
- User authentication functioning properly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required

1. **Fix Date Overlap Validation**
   ```javascript
   // Suggested implementation in backend/src/routes/leaves.ts
   // Before creating a new leave request, check for overlapping dates
   const overlappingRequest = await prisma.leaveRequest.findFirst({
     where: {
       employeeId: req.user.userId,
       status: { in: ['PENDING', 'APPROVED'] },
       OR: [
         {
           AND: [
             { startDate: { lte: new Date(endDate) } },
             { endDate: { gte: new Date(startDate) } }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   });

   if (overlappingRequest) {
     throw new AppError('Leave request overlaps with existing request', 400);
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Balance Deduction Logic**
   ```javascript
   // In the leave approval workflow
   if (request.status === 'APPROVED') {
     await prisma.leaveBalance.update({
       where: {
         employeeId_leaveType_year: {
           employeeId: request.employeeId,
           leaveType: request.leaveType,
           year: new Date().getFullYear()
         }
       },
       data: {
         used: { increment: request.totalDays },
         available: { decrement: request.totalDays }
       }
     });
   }
   ```

### Testing Enhancements

1. **Add Unit Tests** for overlap validation logic
2. **Add Integration Tests** for balance deduction workflows
3. **Implement E2E Tests** covering complete leave application workflows
4. **Add Database Transaction Tests** to ensure data consistency

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Add Logging** for balance deduction operations
2. **Implement Alerts** for unusual leave patterns (multiple requests same dates)
3. **Add Audit Trail** for all leave-related operations
4. **Create Reports** for leave balance discrepancies

## Test Environment Details

### System Configuration
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, Prisma ORM
- **Database:** SQLite (test environment)
- **Frontend:** React with Material-UI
- **Authentication:** JWT-based
- **Real-time:** WebSocket integration

### User Test Data
- **User:** Rajesh Kumar (mgr-engineering)
- **Role:** MANAGER
- **Department:** Engineering
- **Location:** Bengaluru
- **Leave Balances:**
  - CASUAL_LEAVE: 12 days
  - SICK_LEAVE: 12 days
  - EARNED_LEAVE: 21 days
  - COMPENSATORY_OFF: 10 days

## Conclusion

The Leave Management System shows good basic functionality with proper authentication, leave creation, and half-day calculations working correctly. However, two critical issues need immediate attention:

1. **Date overlap validation** must be implemented to prevent multiple leave types for the same period
2. **Leave balance deduction** logic needs to be fixed to ensure proper tracking of leave utilization

The **leave type retention issue originally reported appears to be resolved** in the current system, with all leave types being properly preserved and displayed.

**Priority:** These issues should be addressed before production deployment to prevent business rule violations and incorrect leave balance tracking.
