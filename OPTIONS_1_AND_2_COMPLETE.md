## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Check logs daily for automation job status
- Monitor `MonthlyAccrual` table for accrual history
- Review `LeaveBalance` table for accuracy
- Check scheduler status via API

### Troubleshooting

#### Issue: Monthly accrual didn't run
```bash
# Check scheduler status
curl /api/v1/automation/scheduler/status

# Manually trigger
curl -X POST /api/v1/automation/monthly-accrual/trigger
```

#### Issue: Year-end carry-forward failed
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f backend/logs/app.log

# Manually trigger for specific year
curl -X POST /api/v1/automation/year-end-carryforward/trigger \
  -d '{"year": 2025}'
```

#### Issue: Validation not working
```bash
# Check if validation engine is enabled
grep "ENABLED" backend/src/routes/leaves.ts

# Should see: "‚úÖ ENABLED: Policy validation"
```
