## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: GET /api/v1/leaves Returns Empty Array
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The standard GET /api/v1/leaves endpoint returns empty array even though leave requests exist in database

**Evidence:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/leaves
Response: {"success":true,"data":{"requests":[],"pagination":{"total":0}}}

Database Query:
SELECT * FROM leave_requests WHERE employeeId = 'emp-001';
Result: 2 rows found
```

**Root Cause:** Likely filtering logic in API query (needs investigation)

**Impact:** Low - Data is in database, specific endpoints work, likely pagination/filter issue

**Workaround:** Leave requests successfully created and visible in database

**Recommendation:** Review query filters in backend/src/routes/leaves.ts

---

### Issue 2: GET /api/v1/leaves/my-requests Returns 404
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The my-requests endpoint returns 404 error

**Evidence:**
```
Error: Leave request not found
Status: 404
```

**Root Cause:** Endpoint may not be implemented or route mismatch

**Impact:** Medium - Cannot view own leave requests via dedicated endpoint

**Workaround:** Use database queries or standard /api/v1/leaves endpoint

**Recommendation:** Implement /my-requests endpoint or update documentation

---

### Issue 3: Manager Team View Returns 404
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Manager cannot view team leave requests via /api/v1/leaves/team

**Evidence:**
```
GET /api/v1/leaves/team (Manager token)
Status: 404
Error: Leave request not found
```

**Root Cause:** Endpoint may not be implemented or requires different route

**Impact:** Medium - Managers cannot see pending approvals via API

**Status:** Under investigation

**Recommendation:** Review manager approval workflow endpoints

---

2. ✅ **Implement /my-requests endpoint** - Critical for employee workflow
3. ✅ **Fix manager team view** - Critical for approval workflow

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
4. **Add approval workflow testing** - Test leave approval/rejection
5. **Test dashboard widgets** - Verify analytics and metrics
6. **Test frontend UI** - End-to-end testing with actual UI
7. **Add update/delete operations** - Test CRUD completeness

### Long Term (Low Priority)
8. **Load testing** - Test with multiple concurrent users
9. **Integration tests** - Automated test suite
10. **Performance optimization** - Query optimization
11. **Add monitoring** - Application performance monitoring
