2. **Email Actions:** Approve/Reject links in emails expire after 30 minutes (unusable)
3. **Scheduled Jobs:** Year-end carry-forward, monthly accrual, comp off expiry not fully tested
4. **UX Gaps:** Rejection reasons not visible to employees, overlapping leaves not highlighted
5. **Configurability:** 15 business rules hardcoded (inflexible for policy changes)

### 🎯 Top Priority Actions

1. **Fix email action token expiry (DEF-003)** - 8 hours dev effort
2. **Optimize performance for 500 users (DEF-005)** - 16 hours dev effort
3. **Execute year-end carry-forward job in staging** - CRITICAL before Dec 31
