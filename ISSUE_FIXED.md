# ✅ Date Picker Issue - FIXED

## Issue
The `EnhancedDatePicker` component was throwing an error:
```
MUI: Can not find the date and time pickers localization context.
It looks like you forgot to wrap your component in LocalizationProvider.
```

## Root Cause
The `@mui/x-date-pickers` components require a `LocalizationProvider` wrapper at the application root level to provide date formatting and localization context.

## Solution Applied ✅

### **1. Added LocalizationProvider to Root**
**File**: `frontend/src/main.tsx`

Added the provider at the application root:
```tsx
import { LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/LocalizationProvider'
import { AdapterDayjs } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/AdapterDayjs'

<LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>
  <App />
</LocalizationProvider>
```

### **2. Removed Duplicate Provider**
**File**: `frontend/src/components/forms/EnhancedDatePicker.tsx`

Removed the redundant `LocalizationProvider` wrapper inside the component since it's now at the root level.

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - The application now works correctly with all date picker components.

## Testing
After the fix, all date pickers in the application work properly:
- ✅ EnhancedDatePicker component
- ✅ Existing DatePicker components
- ✅ Calendar views
- ✅ No console errors

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/main.tsx` - Added LocalizationProvider
2. `frontend/src/components/forms/EnhancedDatePicker.tsx` - Removed duplicate provider
3. `FORM_COMPONENTS_GUIDE.md` - Updated documentation

## Important Note
⚠️ **The `LocalizationProvider` must remain at the root level in `main.tsx`**. Do not remove it, as all date picker components depend on it.
